# Link_Noise
Study dynamics of different networks when subjected to changing link strengths

## Workflow:
1) Looked at dynamics of RS_TS without any noise, and with dynamic link strengths.
2) Introduced Random link strengths in RS_TS, too noisy to observe anything.
3) Looked at individual components of RS_TS.
4) TS: Our noise affected the MRTs of all 4 states, can be seen in figures, couldnt see much effect from our delay.
5) RS: Noise disrupted oscillations, delay seemed to preserve oscillations, performed FFT to confirm, yet to analyse those clearly.
6) TT: Lastly looked at toggle triad, clear change in MRTs due to increasing noise, follows a pattern, no delay introduced.
7) Also looked at whether or not delay in RS might stabilize TS w/o delay. No concrete observations were made, could be a possibility, needs more analysis.
